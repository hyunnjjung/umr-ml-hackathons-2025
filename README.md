## UMR ML Hackathons 2025

This repository contains my solutions for two machine learning hackathons from the **Machine Learning** course at the University of Marburg, summer term 2025 🎓

### Hackathon 1: Bicycle Count Prediction 🚲

**Description:**  
Predict the daily number of bicycles observed at a counting station in Germany. Input features include date information, holiday periods, and weather data 

**Dataset:**  
Dataset is from a private university course hackathon and is not publicly available

**Notebook:**  
`bicycle_count_prediction.ipynb`

### Hackathon 2: EuroSAT - Land Use and Land Cover Classification 🌍

**Description:**  
Classification of land use and land cover using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The dataset contains 27,000 labeled geo-referenced images across 10 classes, with 13 spectral bands. The goal is to achieve high accuracy using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 

**Dataset:**  
Dataset is from a private hackathon and cannot be shared here
The official EuroSAT dataset is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat)

**Notebook:**  
`land_use_classification.ipynb`

### Notes 📝

- Both hackathons were private competitions held as part of the university course, hence datasets and competition links are not shared here  
- Notebooks are self-contained and can be run independently
